# Computational vs Psychological Concepts - Clarification

## Important Distinction

This repository contains both **psychological content** and **computational examples**. It's crucial to understand that these represent fundamentally different domains:

### Psychological Concepts
- **Domain**: Human mind, behavior, cognition, and mental processes
- **Methods**: Empirical research, clinical observation, statistical analysis
- **Examples**: Cognitive biases, mental shortcuts, personality types, therapeutic approaches

### Computational Concepts  
- **Domain**: Computer science, algorithms, programming languages, and formal systems
- **Methods**: Mathematical logic, algorithmic thinking, formal proofs
- **Examples**: Programming languages (BrainFuck, Coq), Turing completeness, algorithmic complexity

## Key Clarifications

### 1. BrainFuck Programming Language
The **BrainFuck** programming language examples in this repository are purely computational:
- It's an esoteric programming language designed for minimal instruction sets
- Despite the name containing "brain," it has **no relation** to neuroscience or psychology
- It's included here as part of technical demonstrations, not psychological content

### 2. Formal Logic (Coq)
The **Coq** theorem proving examples:
- Represent formal mathematical proofs about psychological concepts
- Are computational tools for modeling psychological phenomena
- Should not be confused with the psychological phenomena themselves

### 3. Turing Completeness
**Turing completeness** is a computational concept that refers to:
- A system's ability to simulate any Turing machine
- Computational universality in computer science
- **Not** a psychological process or cognitive ability

## Guidelines for Content

When encountering computational examples in this repository:

1. **Recognize the Context**: Distinguish between psychology content and technical demonstrations
2. **Understand the Purpose**: Computational examples may be used to model or represent psychological concepts, but they are not the concepts themselves
3. **Avoid Conflation**: Don't confuse computational processes with psychological processes

## Repository Structure Clarification

- **Psychology Files**: `.md` files containing research, theories, and observations about human psychology
- **Computational Files**: `.py`, `.v`, `.ipynb` files and technical sections within `.md` files
- **Mixed Content**: Some files contain both psychological content and computational representations

**Note**: Computation is a tool that can be used to study, model, or demonstrate psychological concepts, but computational processes are not equivalent to psychological processes.
